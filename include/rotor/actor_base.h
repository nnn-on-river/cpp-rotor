/** \struct actor_base_t
 *  \brief universal primitive of concurrent computation
 *
 *  The class is base class for user-defined actors. It is expected that
 * actors will react on incoming messages (e.g. by changing internal
 * /private state) or send (other) messages to other actors, or do
 * some side-effects (I/O, etc.).
 *
 * Message passing interface is asynchronous, they are send to {@link supervisor_t}.
 *
 * Every actor belong to some {@link supervisor_t}, which "injects" the thread-safe
 * execution context, in a sense, that the actor can call it's own methods as well
 * as supervirors without any need of synchonization.
 *
 * All actor methods are thread-unsafe, i.e. should not be called with except of
 * it's own supervisor. Communication with actor should be performed via messages.
 *
 * Actor is addressed by it's "main" address; however it is possible for an actor
 * to have multiple identities aka "virtual" addresses.
 *
